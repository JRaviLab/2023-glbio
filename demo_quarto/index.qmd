## What's Quarto?

[Quarto](https://quarto.org) enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. Explore Quarto's [formats](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/all-formats.html), [themes](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html), and more [here](https://quarto.org/docs/guide)!

### Install Quarto
Quarto is language-agnostic: you can [install](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) it from the terminal, through RStudio, or VSCode. You can incorporate R/Py/Julia/Observable scripts seamlessly and weave them together into a single website, html_doc, dashboard, e-book, presentation, or publication of your choice!
